## Executive Summary

### Motivation

Peer-to-peer networks built on libp2p require nodes to determine whether
their addresses are reachable from the internet. Most residential and
mobile devices sit behind Network Address Translation (NAT) — a router
technique that maps private IP addresses to a shared public IP. While
NAT allows outbound connections, it blocks most inbound traffic. A node
that doesn't know it's behind NAT may advertise unreachable addresses,
participate as a DHT server when it can't serve queries, or fail to
reserve relay connections it needs.

libp2p's **AutoNAT** protocol solves this by having peers test whether a
node's addresses are actually dialable from outside. AutoNAT v1 uses a
simple majority vote; AutoNAT v2 (specified 2023, deployed 2024)
improves on this with per-address testing and nonce-based verification.

However, multiple libp2p-based projects have reported that reachability
detection **does not work reliably in production**:

- **Obol Network** ([Charon](https://github.com/ObolNetwork/charon),
  go-libp2p v0.47.0): Distributed validator nodes running behind home
  or corporate NAT experience oscillating reachability status. Their
  Prometheus metric `p2p_reachability_status` flips between public and
  private, triggering unnecessary relay activation and DHT client mode
  — degrading validator coordination through higher-latency relay paths.

- **Avail Network** ([avail-light](https://github.com/availproject/avail-light),
  rust-libp2p v0.55.0): Light clients reported persistent
  "autonat-over-quic libp2p errors" starting from v1.7.4. The team
  ultimately **disabled AutoNAT entirely** in v1.13.2 (September 2025),
  forcing operators to manually set `--external-address` for DHT server
  mode — defeating the purpose of automatic reachability detection.

These are not isolated incidents. They reflect fundamental issues in how
AutoNAT determines and communicates reachability across the libp2p
ecosystem. This project investigates AutoNAT v2 and evaluates whether it succeeds.

See [obol.md](obol.md) and [avail.md](avail.md) for detailed impact
analysis on each project.

### Findings

AutoNAT v2 is a significant improvement over v1 in per-address
reachability detection. In controlled testbed conditions, it produces
**0% false negative rate and 0% false positive rate** across all
non-edge-case NAT types, converges in ~6 seconds, and is resilient to
high latency and packet loss (QUIC adds only +1% convergence time at 10%
packet loss vs TCP's +147%).

However, we identified **7 findings** that affect its real-world
effectiveness — ranging from protocol-level design issues to
implementation gaps and cross-implementation inconsistencies.

The most impactful finding is that **v2's results are not consumed by the
systems that matter most** (DHT, AutoRelay) in go-libp2p, the only
implementation where v2 is deployed in production. v1 still controls the
global reachability flag, and v1 oscillates under real-world conditions
(3 out of 5 testbed runs with unreliable servers show v1 flipping between
Public and Private while v2 remains stable). This directly explains the
oscillation observed by Obol.

Cross-implementation analysis reveals that **only go-libp2p has a
functional AutoNAT v2 deployment**. rust-libp2p works correctly when
properly configured but lacks a safety net when TCP port reuse fails — which,
combined with the QUIC dial-back issue, explains the errors that led
Avail to disable AutoNAT. js-libp2p emits no reachability events.
Neither has a production consumer (Substrate skips autonat entirely;
Helia uses v1 only).

## Background

### NAT Types

NAT behavior is defined by two independent properties: **mapping**
(how the router assigns external ports) and **filtering** (which
inbound packets are allowed through).

| NAT Type | Mapping | Filtering | Inbound from strangers | Prevalence |
|----------|---------|-----------|----------------------|------------|
| **No NAT** | — | — | Always works | Servers, cloud |
| **Full-cone** | EIM | EIF | Always works | Rare (intentional DMZ/forward) |
| **Address-restricted** | EIM | ADF | Only from previously contacted IPs | Rare in modern routers |
| **Port-restricted** | EIM | APDF | Only from exact previously contacted IP:port | Most common home router default |
| **Symmetric** | ADPM | APDF | Never (different port per destination) | CGNAT, mobile carriers |

For the full mapping/filtering taxonomy (RFC 4787), see
[autonat-v2.md](autonat-v2.md).

### Related Protocols in libp2p

AutoNAT does not operate in isolation. It is part of a protocol stack
where each component handles a different aspect of connectivity:

**Identify** (`/ipfs/id/1.0.0`) — When two peers connect, they exchange
metadata including the `ObservedAddr` — the address each peer sees the
other connecting from. This is how a node discovers its external address
(the NAT-mapped public IP:port). Identify is the **input** to AutoNAT:
the observed addresses become candidates for reachability testing.

**AutoNAT v1** (`/libp2p/autonat/1.0.0`) — The original reachability
protocol. A node asks a random connected peer to dial it back. The peer
reports success or failure. v1 produces a **global** verdict
(Public/Private/Unknown) based on a majority vote across recent probes.

**AutoNAT v2** (`/libp2p/autonat/2/dial-request`,
`/libp2p/autonat/2/dial-back`) — The improved protocol tested in this
report. Tests **individual addresses** with nonce-based verification and
amplification protection. Produces per-address reachability.

**Circuit Relay v2** (`/libp2p/circuit/relay/0.2.0/hop`,
`/libp2p/circuit/relay/0.2.0/stop`) — When a node is determined to be
behind NAT, it reserves a relay slot on a public node. Other peers
connect through the relay as a fallback.

**DCUtR** (`/libp2p/dcutr`) — Direct Connection Upgrade through Relay.
After connecting via relay, peers attempt hole punching to establish a
direct connection, eliminating the relay overhead.

**Kademlia DHT** — Uses the reachability signal to decide server vs
client mode. Server-mode nodes accept and serve DHT queries; client-mode
nodes only issue queries. The DHT subscribes to AutoNAT v1's global
flag (not v2's per-address signal).

The dependency chain:

```
Identify (discover external address)
  → ObservedAddrManager (consolidate observations, activation threshold)
    → AutoNAT v2 (test address reachability)
      → EvtHostReachableAddrsChanged (per-address result)
    → AutoNAT v1 (test global reachability)
      → EvtLocalReachabilityChanged (global result)
        → DHT mode (server/client)
        → AutoRelay (reserve relay if private)
          → DCUtR (hole punch if relayed)
```

### How NAT Filtering Affects AutoNAT v2 Dial-Back

When the server's `dialerHost` dials back to the client, the NAT's
filtering decision determines whether the connection reaches the client:

```
Client behind NAT contacted Server at 1.2.3.4:5000
NAT mapping: client:4001 → 203.0.113.1:50000

Server's dialerHost dials back from 1.2.3.4:random_port to 203.0.113.1:50000

Full-cone (EIF):       "Any source allowed"                → PASS
Addr-restricted (ADF): "Is 1.2.3.4 trusted? YES"          → PASS ← Finding #4
Port-restricted (APDF):"Is 1.2.3.4:random trusted? NO"    → BLOCK (correct)
Symmetric (APDF):      N/A — v2 never reaches this stage   ← Finding #5
```

### AutoNAT v1 vs v2

| Aspect | v1 | v2 |
|--------|----|----|
| **Protocol** | `/libp2p/autonat/1.0.0` | `/libp2p/autonat/2/dial-request` + `dial-back` |
| **Scope** | Global (whole-node: Public/Private) | Per-address (each address independently) |
| **Probing** | Random peer, majority vote | Specific server selection, per-address confidence |
| **Confidence** | Sliding window of 3 | Sliding window of 5, targetConfidence=3 |
| **Nonce verification** | No | Yes (prevents spoofing) |
| **Amplification protection** | No | Yes (30-100KB data when IP differs) |
| **Dial-back identity** | Same peer ID | Separate peer ID (go-libp2p) |
| **Event (go-libp2p)** | `EvtLocalReachabilityChanged` | `EvtHostReachableAddrsChanged` |
| **DHT consumes** | **Yes** | **No** (Finding #1) |
| **Spec** | Informal, no RFC | [specs/autonat/autonat-v2.md](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/master/autonat/autonat-v2.md) |

### Scope of This Study

This report evaluates AutoNAT v2's correctness, performance, and
integration across three libp2p implementations (go, rust, js). It
does NOT evaluate:

- Hole punching success rates (DCUtR) — see Trautwein et al. 2022/2025
- Relay performance (Circuit Relay v2)
- DHT performance itself (routing, lookup latency)
- AutoNAT v1 in isolation (only v1/v2 comparison)

### NAT Traversal: libp2p vs Traditional

| Step | Traditional (STUN/ICE) | libp2p |
|------|----------------------|--------|
| Discover external address | STUN binding request | Identify protocol (ObservedAddr) |
| Test reachability | STUN from **multiple IPs** (RFC 5780) | AutoNAT from **same IP** |
| Direct connection | ICE candidate exchange | DCUtR via relay |
| Fallback relay | TURN server | Circuit Relay v2 |

The key difference at step 2: STUN tests from multiple IPs, which
distinguishes full-cone from address-restricted. AutoNAT v2 tests from
the same IP the client already contacted, making these indistinguishable.

**Networks:**
- `public-net` (73.0.0.0/24) — uses a "public-looking" range because
  go-libp2p's `manet.IsPublicAddr()` filters out private/CGNAT ranges.
  AutoNAT v2 only probes addresses that pass this filter.
- `private-net` (10.0.1.0/24) — standard private range, matching
  real-world deployments.

**Components:**
- **Router** — Alpine container with iptables. Implements all 5 NAT
  types via masquerade + filtering rules. Also supports `tc netem` for
  latency/packet-loss injection, static port forwarding (DNAT), and
  miniupnpd for UPnP emulation.
- **Servers** (3-7) — go-libp2p nodes running AutoNAT v2 server with
  our probe-lab fork (OTel instrumentation + UDP black hole fix).
  Write multiaddrs to a shared Docker volume for client discovery.
- **Client** — go-libp2p (primary), rust-libp2p, or js-libp2p node
  behind the router. Reads server addresses from shared volume.
  Exports OTel spans to Jaeger.
- **Jaeger** — OTel trace collector on both networks. `run.py` queries
  Jaeger API for convergence detection and trace export.
- **Orchestrator** — `run.py` reads YAML scenario files, manages Docker
  Compose lifecycle, waits for convergence via Jaeger polling, exports
  traces as JSONL for `analyze.py`.

### Scenario Parameters

Experiments are defined in YAML scenario files with the following
configurable parameters:

| Parameter | Values tested | Description |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| `nat_type` | none, full-cone, address-restricted, port-restricted, symmetric | NAT filtering/mapping behavior |
| `transport` | tcp, quic, both | Client transport protocol |
| `server_count` | 3, 5, 7 | Number of AutoNAT servers |
| `latency_ms` | 10, 200, 500 | One-way added latency via `tc netem` (RTT = 2×) |
| `packet_loss` | 0, 1, 5, 10 (%) | Packet loss via `tc netem` on router |
| `port_forward` | true/false | Static DNAT from router public IP to client |
| `upnp` | true/false | miniupnpd on router for dynamic port mapping |
| `obs_addr_thresh` | 1, 2, 4 | Override observed address activation threshold |
| `unreliable_servers` | 0, 5 | Servers with dial-back blocked (for v1 oscillation) |
| `autonat_refresh` | 0, 30 (s) | **v1 only:** refresh interval override (default 15 min). Shortened to 30s in v1/v2 gap scenarios to observe oscillation within testbed timeouts. |
| `timeout_s` | 120, 600 | Per-scenario timeout |
| `runs` | 1, 20 | Repeated runs for statistical confidence |

### Experiment Matrix

| Scenario file | Scenarios | Runs | What it tests |
|--------------|-----------|------|---------------|
| `matrix.yaml` | 10 | 1 each | Baseline: 5 NATs × 2 transports (server_count=7) |
| `high-latency.yaml` | 16 | 1 each | 4 NATs × 2 transports × {200ms, 500ms} latency |
| `packet-loss.yaml` | 24 | 1 each | 4 NATs × 2 transports × {1%, 5%, 10%} loss |
| `adf-false-positive.yaml` | 6 | 20 each | ADF vs APDF × 3 transports (120 total) |
| `reachable-forwarded.yaml` | 5 | 1 each | Port forwarding toggle detection (600s timeout, 2 phases) |
| `v1-v2-gap.yaml` | 2 | 1 each | 2 reliable + 5 unreliable servers (600s observation) |
| `threshold-sensitivity.yaml` | 6 | 1 each | obs_addr_thresh {1,2,4} × {no-NAT, symmetric} |

**Total: 178 runs** producing OTel traces analyzed by `analyze.py`.

### Metrics Collected

From each run, `analyze.py` extracts:

- **FNR** — was a reachable node detected as reachable?
- **FPR** — was an unreachable node incorrectly detected as reachable?
- **TTC** — time from node start to first `reachable_addrs_changed` or
  `reachability_changed` event with a definitive result
- **TTU** — time from port forwarding toggle to detection of the change
- **Probe count** — number of `autonatv2.probe` spans per session
- **v1 flips** — number of `reachability_changed` events (oscillation indicator)

## Findings

### Finding 1: v1/v2 Reachability Gap

**Category:** go-libp2p | **Severity:** High

**Problem:** v2's per-address reachability results are ignored by every
go-libp2p subsystem that matters. DHT, AutoRelay, Address Manager, and
NAT Service all consume v1's global flag (`EvtLocalReachabilityChanged`)
and are blind to v2's per-address signal (`EvtHostReachableAddrsChanged`).

**Impact:** A node with v2-confirmed reachable addresses can
simultaneously have v1 reporting Private — triggering unnecessary relay
usage and DHT client mode. On a residential router with UPnP, v2
detected reachability at ~22s while v1 took ~106s — an 84s gap where the
node is reachable but the DHT thinks it's private.

**Solution:** Bridge v2 into v1's global flag with a reduction function:
"PUBLIC if any v2-confirmed address is reachable." This makes all
existing consumers benefit from v2 without changing their code.

| Consumer | Event consumed | v2 aware? |
|----------|---------------|-----------|
| Kademlia DHT | `EvtLocalReachabilityChanged` (v1) | **No** |
| AutoRelay | `EvtLocalReachabilityChanged` (v1) | **No** |
| Address Manager | `EvtLocalReachabilityChanged` (v1) | **No** |
| NAT Service | `EvtLocalReachabilityChanged` (v1) | **No** |

**Cross-implementation:** Only go-libp2p affected. rust-libp2p's DHT uses
`ExternalAddrConfirmed` (v2 path); js-libp2p uses address-level events.

**Full analysis:** [v1-v2-reachability-gap.md](v1-v2-reachability-gap.md)

### Finding 2: v1 Oscillation → DHT Oscillation

**Category:** go-libp2p | **Severity:** High

**Problem:** v1 uses random peer selection and a sliding window of 3. A
single failed dial-back from an unreliable peer flips Public→Private,
causing DHT mode switches and relay churn.

**Impact:** In testbed with 5/7 unreliable servers, v1 oscillated in 60%
of runs. v2 oscillated in 0%. This directly explains the oscillating
`p2p_reachability_status` Prometheus metric reported by Obol/Charon
operators, which degrades validator coordination through higher-latency
relay paths.

**Solution:** Suppress v1 probing once v2 reaches targetConfidence.
v2's explicit server selection and per-address confidence system
eliminate the random-peer problem entirely.

![v1/v2 Gap Comparison](../results/figures/10_v1_v2_gap_comparison.png)
*Figure 1: v1 oscillates (red segments) while v2 stays stable (green). Three unreliable server ratios.*

| Metric | v1 | v2 |
|--------|----|----|
| Oscillation rate (5/7 unreliable) | 60% of runs | **0%** |
| Stability after convergence | Flips on random peer failure | Stable (targetConfidence=3) |

**Cross-implementation:** go-libp2p affected. js-libp2p's v1 is
mitigated (monotonic counters + TTL). rust-libp2p doesn't consume v1.

**Full analysis:** [v1-vs-v2-performance.md](v1-vs-v2-performance.md)

### Finding 3: Address-Restricted NAT False Positive

**Category:** Protocol design | **Severity:** Medium

**Problem:** AutoNAT v2 produces 100% false positive rate for nodes
behind address-restricted NAT (EIM + ADF). The dial-back comes from the
same IP the client already contacted, so the NAT allows it through —
making the node appear reachable when it isn't.

**Impact:** Nodes behind ADF NAT advertise unreachable addresses. Peers
attempting direct connections fail, adding latency before relay fallback.
Real-world impact is likely low (ADF is rare in modern routers, most
default to APDF), but no measurement data exists to quantify prevalence.

**Solution:** Require dial-back from a different IP than the one the
client contacted (multi-server verification). This would distinguish ADF
from full-cone NAT. Alternatively, document the limitation in the spec.

**Testbed evidence:** 120 runs — deterministic, not probabilistic.

| NAT type | Runs | Reported reachable | FPR |
|----------|------|-------------------|-----|
| Address-restricted (ADF) | 60 | 60/60 | **100%** |
| Port-restricted (APDF) | 60 | 0/60 | **0%** |

![Detection Correctness](../results/figures/05_detection_correctness.png)
*Figure 2: Detection correctness heatmap — address-restricted reports reachable (false positive).*

**Cross-implementation:** Protocol-level issue — affects all
implementations identically.

**Full analysis:** [adf-false-positive.md](adf-false-positive.md)

### Finding 4: Symmetric NAT Silent Failure

**Category:** Protocol design | **Severity:** Medium

**Problem:** Under symmetric NAT (ADPM), each outbound connection uses a
different external port. No address reaches `ActivationThresh=4` →
AutoNAT v2 never runs → no reachability signal at all. The node stays
in "unknown" permanently.

**Impact:** Nodes behind symmetric NAT (CGNAT, mobile carriers) get no
reachability determination. They cannot enter DHT server mode, cannot
detect reachability gained through port forwarding, and produce no
signal for operators to act on. Estimated ~11% of peers are behind
symmetric NAT (Halkes 2011; current numbers unknown).

**Solution:** Wire go-libp2p's existing `getNATType()` detection
(which correctly identifies symmetric NAT as `EndpointDependent`) into
either lowering the activation threshold or emitting UNREACHABLE
directly. With `ActivationThresh=1`, testbed confirms correct
UNREACHABLE determination. The security tradeoff is small: observer-IP
deduplication means a single attacker IP can only contribute 1
observation regardless of sybil count.

**Testbed evidence:**

| Threshold | NAT type | Result |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| 4 (default) | symmetric | NO SIGNAL |
| 1 | symmetric | **UNREACHABLE** (correct) |

**UPnP bypass:** UPnP-mapped addresses bypass the threshold entirely
(enter via `appendNATAddrs()`). Local testing confirmed: with UPnP,
symmetric NAT nodes get correct reachability at ~22s.

**Cross-implementation:**
| | go-libp2p | rust-libp2p | js-libp2p |
|-|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| Affected? | **Yes** — NO SIGNAL (threshold blocks) | **No** — no threshold, produces UNREACHABLE | **Yes** — NO SIGNAL (different root cause) |

**Full analysis:** [#89](https://github.com/probe-lab/autonat-project/issues/89),
[upnp-nat-detection.md](upnp-nat-detection.md)

### Finding 5: UDP Black Hole Detector Blocks QUIC Dial-Back

**Category:** go-libp2p | **Severity:** Medium

**Problem:** The AutoNAT v2 `dialerHost` shares the main host's
`UDPBlackHoleSuccessCounter`. On fresh servers with zero UDP history,
the counter enters Blocked state → QUIC dial-backs refused → the server
actively reports QUIC addresses as unreachable (false negative).

**Impact:** QUIC addresses are incorrectly reported as unreachable on
new or restarted AutoNAT servers, until sufficient UDP traffic builds
the counter history. Affects every go-libp2p node acting as an AutoNAT
server.

**Solution:** Disable the UDP black hole detector on `dialerHost`,
matching the existing v1 fix ([PR #2529](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p/pull/2529)).
5 fix options analyzed in [udp-black-hole-detector.md](udp-black-hole-detector.md).

**Cross-implementation:** go-libp2p only. rust-libp2p and js-libp2p
have no black hole detector.

**Full analysis:** [udp-black-hole-detector.md](udp-black-hole-detector.md)

### Finding 6: rust-libp2p TCP Port Reuse Safety Net

**Category:** Cross-implementation | **Severity:** Low

**Problem:** When TCP port reuse fails silently in rust-libp2p, the
connection metadata still says `PortUse::Reuse` despite using an
ephemeral port. The identify protocol skips address translation, causing
AutoNAT v2 to probe the wrong port (100% false negative).

**Impact:** Low in practice — the issue only manifests when TCP listeners
aren't ready before outbound connections start (a startup timing issue).
When properly configured, rust-libp2p v2 produces correct results for
all NAT types, matching go-libp2p.

**Cross-implementation:** go-libp2p is unaffected (its `ObservedAddrManager`
corrects ports independently). rust-libp2p has no equivalent safety net.

**Full analysis:** [rust-libp2p-autonat-implementation.md](rust-libp2p-autonat-implementation.md)

### Finding 7: v2 Adoption Gap

**Category:** Cross-implementation | **Severity:** Info

AutoNAT v2 exists in all three libp2p implementations but **only Kubo
deploys it in production**. Across the broader ecosystem (~25 projects
using libp2p), only Kubo and Pactus use v2. Most projects either use
v1, use UPnP instead, or skip AutoNAT entirely. See
[libp2p-autonat-ecosystem.md](libp2p-autonat-ecosystem.md) for the full
survey.

| Project | Language | AutoNAT status | v2 functional? |
|---------|----------|---------------|----------------|
| **Kubo** | Go | v1 + v2 (both active) | **Yes** — 0% FNR/FPR |
| **Helia** | JS | v1 only | Untested in production |
| **Substrate** | Rust | Disabled entirely | Works when properly configured (Finding #6) |
| **Avail** | Rust | **Disabled** (v1.13.2) | Broke in production, turned off |

The protocol itself works when the implementation is correct (go-libp2p:
0% FNR/FPR). The cross-implementation issues are in the surrounding
infrastructure (address management, event model), not in the AutoNAT v2
protocol logic.

## Key Metrics

From 178 testbed runs:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| False Negative Rate (non-symmetric) | **0%** |
| False Positive Rate (non-ADF) | **0%** |
| ADF False Positive Rate | **100%** |
| Baseline TTC (TCP) | ~6,000ms |
| Baseline TTC (QUIC) | ~6,000-11,000ms |
| Probes to converge | 3 (= targetConfidence) |
| v1 oscillation rate (5/7 unreliable) | 60% |
| v2 oscillation rate | **0%** |
| TTU: port forward added | ~30s |
| TTU: port forward removed | ~69s |
| UPnP TTC (local, port-restricted NAT) | ~22s (v2) vs ~106s (v1) |

### Transport Resilience Under Packet Loss

Both TCP and QUIC maintain **0% FNR/FPR** under all tested packet loss
conditions — correctness is unaffected. Convergence time increases for
both transports as loss increases, but **neither shows a consistent
advantage over the other**.

Initial single-run data suggested a dramatic QUIC advantage (+1% vs
+147% TTC increase at 10% loss). A follow-up investigation with 3 runs
per scenario across 7 loss levels (2-15%) showed this was a
**statistical artifact from insufficient runs**:

| Loss % | TCP avg (ms) | QUIC avg (ms) | Difference |
|--------|-------------|---------------|------------|
| 2% | 5,010 | 5,010 | None |
| 5% | 8,052 | 9,408 | QUIC slightly slower |
| 10% | 10,014 | 13,757 | QUIC slower |
| 15% | 16,813 | 9,734 | TCP slower |

Convergence times are quantized to ~5s intervals (the probe refresh
cycle). A lost probe retries on the next cycle regardless of transport.
The variance is dominated by **which probe cycle gets hit by loss**,
not by transport-level retransmission differences. With only 3 runs
per scenario, neither transport shows a statistically significant
advantage. Under latency (no loss), the gap is also within noise
(TCP +432% vs QUIC +233% at 500ms, single runs).

See [#87](https://github.com/probe-lab/autonat-project/issues/87)

## Cross-Implementation Comparison

| Feature | go-libp2p | rust-libp2p | js-libp2p |
|---------|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Maturity** | Primary (May 2024) | Second (Aug 2024) | Third (June 2025) |

| **Confidence system** | Sliding window, targetConfidence=3 | None (single probe) | Fixed thresholds (4/8) |

| **Reachability events** | `EvtHostReachableAddrsChanged` | Per-probe `Event` struct | **None** |
| **v2 → DHT wiring** | No (DHT reads v1 only) | Indirect (`ExternalAddrConfirmed`) | Indirect (`self:peer:update`) |
| **Dial-back identity** | Separate dialerHost | Same swarm | Same identity |
| **Rate limiting** | 60 RPM global, 12/peer | Basic concurrent limit | Stream limits only |

## Recommendations

### For go-libp2p (highest impact)

1. **Bridge v2 into v1 global flag** — Add a reduction function: "PUBLIC
   if any v2-confirmed address is reachable." This makes DHT, AutoRelay,
   and Address Manager benefit from v2 without changing their code.

2. **Disable black hole detector on dialerHost** — Match the v1 fix
   (PR #2529). [5 options analyzed](udp-black-hole-detector.md#proposed-upstream-fixes).

3. **Deprecate v1 probing when v2 has data** — Suppress v1 once v2
   reaches targetConfidence to prevent oscillation.

### For rust-libp2p

4. **Fix silent `PortUse::Reuse` fallback** — When TCP port reuse
   fails and falls back to an ephemeral port, identify skips address
   translation because the connection is still marked `Reuse`. Either
   identify should check the actual local port, or the TCP transport
   should report the actual outcome. Optionally, add an
   `ObservedAddrManager`-equivalent as a safety net.

### For js-libp2p

5. **Emit reachability events** — Expose autonat v2 probe results to
   consumers.

6. **Upgrade Helia to v2** — v1's monotonic counters are
   oscillation-resistant but v2 provides per-address granularity.

### For the ecosystem

7. **Measure real-world NAT type distribution** — Deploy monitoring to
   quantify ADF prevalence, symmetric NAT fraction, and v2 adoption.
   See [Future Work](#future-work).

> **Note:** Recommendations for the AutoNAT v2 specification (addressing
> ADF blind spot and symmetric NAT silent failure) are under
> investigation — see [#89](https://github.com/probe-lab/autonat-project/issues/89).
> go-libp2p already detects symmetric NAT via `getNATType()` but how to
> act on it (and whether this is a spec or implementation concern)
> requires further analysis.

## Future Work

### Tier 1: Query Existing Nebula Data

The [Nebula crawler](https://github.com/probe-lab/nebula) already stores
protocol lists, agent versions, and multiaddresses per peer. SQL queries
on the existing database can provide:

- AutoNAT v2 adoption rate (% of peers supporting `/libp2p/autonat/2/dial-request`)
- go-libp2p version distribution (v0.42.0+ has v2 as primary)
- Platform distribution (Go/Rust/JS inferred from `agent_version`)
- TCP vs QUIC address patterns
- Relay-dependent peer count

**Effort:** Days. **Limitation:** Only sees DHT server-mode nodes.

### Tier 2: Full NAT Classification via ants-watch

Use [ants-watch](https://github.com/probe-lab/ants-watch) to deploy
sybil nodes across the full DHT keyspace on 2-3 VPS with different
public IPs. Peers connect to sybils during normal DHT operations,
capturing the **entire active population** including NATted peers
invisible to crawlers.

Multi-vantage observed port comparison classifies all 4 NAT types:
- **Step 1:** Compare observed ports across vantage points (EIM vs ADPM)
- **Step 2:** Unsolicited dial from uncontacted vantage (EIF vs restricted)
- **Step 3:** Contacted vantage dials from different port (ADF vs APDF)

**Effort:** Weeks-months. **Value:** Definitive answer to "how common is
ADF?" and "what fraction is symmetric?"

**Full proposal:** [future-work-nat-monitoring.md](future-work-nat-monitoring.md)

## What v2 Got Right

Despite the issues found, AutoNAT v2 is a substantial improvement:

- **Per-address testing** eliminates v1's "one bad peer ruins everything"
- **Nonce verification** prevents spoofing
- **Amplification protection** (30-100KB) prevents DDoS via protocol abuse
- **Confidence system** (targetConfidence=3) provides stable results
- **0% FNR/FPR** in all non-edge-case scenarios
- **~6s convergence** — fast enough for interactive use
- **UPnP integration** — correctly detects reachability through UPnP-mapped
  ports (both TCP and QUIC), confirmed on a real home router

The protocol design is sound. The issues are in how implementations
integrate v2 into their broader subsystems, and in edge cases (ADF,
symmetric) that the protocol doesn't handle.
